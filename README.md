- Regularly participate in **Codeforces, AtCoder, USACO** contests.  
- Maintain a **problem-solving log** to track mistakes.  

ðŸ”¹ **Road to IOI:**  
- Focus on **graph theory, dynamic programming, combinatorics, and greedy techniques** as they are frequent in IOI problems.  
- Use **CSES, USACO Guide, and AtCoder DP Contest** for specialized training.  

Would you like me to create a **2-year structured learning schedule** based on this roadmap? ðŸš€
